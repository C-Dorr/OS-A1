Assignment 1 README

Assignment 1 was completed by Christopher Dorr & Jordyn Marlow

Compilation:
    In dorrMarlow1/ compile using the command

        g++ -o 5ps 5ps.c options.c

    this will provide an executable which can be ran as described in the 
    following section of this readme.

Using Program:
    5ps provides 5 output options which will display information about
    a process given its process ID (PID). 5ps ran without any options
    will print nothing and exit.

    -p <PID>      The -p option expects one argument, an integer PID.
                  If no PID is given, 5ps will assume PID = 1 for any
                  other option given. PID = 1 is the init command of
                  the machine.
    
    -s            This option will display the single character state
                  of the given process. Find more information on 
                  single character states by running 'man 1 ps' and 
                  looking under the PROCESS STATE CODES header.

    -t            This will display the total consumed time of the
                  process, displayed in HH:MM:SS format.
    
    -v            This option displays the total virtual memory 
                  consumed by the process (in pages).
  
    -c            This option outputs the command-line that started
                  the process.

Shortcomings:
   5ps meets functional critera listed in the assignment. However, the
   notable shortcomings are that
       
       1. Compilation warnings regarding [FILL WARNING DETAILS]

       2. Data about a process will display in the order the options are
          given. For instance './5ps -c -t' provides different, but
          equivalent, output than './5ps -t -c'.
