Assignment 3 README

Assignment 3 was completed by Christopher Dorr & Jordyn Marlow

We used two coupons to get a two day extension on this project, leaving
us with two more coupons.

Compilation:
    Compile using the command

        gcc main.c -o main -lpthread

    this will provide an executable which can be ran as described in the 
    following section of this readme.

Using Program:
    The program requires 3 options, described below:

    -s <number of students>		The -s option expects one integer argument.
                  				This argument is the number of students going
                  				to the party.
    
    -t <number of taxis>		The -t option expects one integer argument.
    							This argument is the number of taxis picking
    							students up from the party.

    -m <max seconds>			The -m option expects one integer argument.
    							This argument is the maximum number of seconds
    							the students can stay at the party.

Shortcomings:
   Main meets functional critera listed in the assignment. However, the
   notable shortcomings are that

       1. The number of students must be four times the number of taxis.

       2. Occasionally, the taxi status will be displayed twice when
       	  full. Once in student, and once in taxi when it leaves.
